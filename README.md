# MA-and-MR-code
This repository contains all of the R code for the Meta-analysis and Mendelian Randomisation sections. Both the Meta-analysis and Mendelian randomisation code contains a frequentist and bayesian approach to the analysis. The frequentist approach for the Meta-analysis was implemented using the metafor package in R and the Bayesian approach was implemented using the brms package in R. The frequentist approach for the Mendelian randomisation was implemented using two different packages for comparison, these are the MendelianRandomization and TwoSampleMR packages in R. The Bayesian approach for the Mendelian randomisation was implemented using the mrbayes package in R.
